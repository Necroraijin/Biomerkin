# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Biomerkin is a multi-agent bioinformatics assistant designed to analyze DNA/protein sequences, fetch relevant literature, suggest drugs, and generate comprehensive doctor-style reports. The system leverages AWS services (Bedrock, Lambda), Biopython, and various bioinformatics APIs to provide end-to-end genomic analysis and treatment recommendations for the AWS Agent Hackathon.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: DNA Sequence Analysis

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to upload DNA sequence files and have them analyzed for genes, mutations, and protein coding sequences, so that I can understand the genetic composition and potential biological implications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DNA sequence file is uploaded THEN the GenomicsAgent SHALL parse the sequence using Biopython
2. WHEN DNA analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL identify genes present in the sequence
3. WHEN DNA analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL detect possible mutations compared to reference sequences
4. WHEN genes are identified THEN the system SHALL translate DNA sequences to protein coding sequences
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL output structured data containing genes, mutations, and protein sequences

### Requirement 2: Protein Structure and Function Analysis

**User Story:** As a bioinformatics researcher, I want protein sequences to be analyzed for structure and function, so that I can understand the biological role and characteristics of the proteins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a protein sequence is provided THEN the ProteomicsAgent SHALL query the PDB API for structure data
2. WHEN protein structure data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL annotate biological function information
3. WHEN protein analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL output protein structure data and functional annotations
4. IF no structure data is available THEN the system SHALL provide alternative functional predictions

### Requirement 3: Literature Research and Summarization

**User Story:** As a medical researcher, I want relevant scientific literature to be automatically searched and summarized, so that I can quickly understand current research related to specific genes, proteins, or mutations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN gene, mutation, or protein function data is available THEN the LiteratureAgent SHALL search PubMed for related articles
2. WHEN research articles are found THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock LLM to summarize key findings
3. WHEN literature analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL output a comprehensive literature summary
4. WHEN no relevant articles are found THEN the system SHALL indicate the absence of literature and suggest alternative search terms

### Requirement 4: Drug Discovery and Clinical Trial Information

**User Story:** As a clinician, I want to identify potential drug candidates and their clinical trial status for specific genes and proteins, so that I can explore treatment options for patients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN gene and protein function data is available THEN the DrugAgent SHALL query DrugBank API for related drugs
2. WHEN drug candidates are identified THEN the system SHALL query ClinicalTrials.gov API for trial status
3. WHEN drug analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL output drug candidates with trial information and known effectiveness
4. IF no drugs are found THEN the system SHALL suggest related therapeutic areas or drug classes

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Report Generation

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want all analysis results combined into a doctor-style research report with treatment recommendations, so that I can make informed decisions about patient care or research directions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all agent analyses are complete THEN the DecisionAgent SHALL combine findings from genomics, proteomics, literature, and drug agents
2. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock LLM to create a coherent, professional medical-style document
3. WHEN the report is generated THEN it SHALL include possible treatment directions based on all available data
4. WHEN the report is complete THEN it SHALL be formatted for medical professional consumption with clear sections and recommendations

### Requirement 6: Sequential Workflow Orchestration

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the multi-agent system to execute in a logical sequence, so that each agent has the necessary input data from previous agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow starts THEN the GenomicsAgent SHALL execute first with DNA sequence input
2. WHEN GenomicsAgent completes THEN the ProteomicsAgent SHALL execute using protein sequence output
3. WHEN ProteomicsAgent completes THEN the LiteratureAgent SHALL execute using gene, mutation, and protein function data
4. WHEN LiteratureAgent completes THEN the DrugAgent SHALL execute using gene and protein function data
5. WHEN DrugAgent completes THEN the DecisionAgent SHALL execute using all previous outputs
6. IF any agent fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and continue with available data

### Requirement 7: AWS Integration and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to leverage AWS services for scalability and performance, so that it can handle multiple concurrent analyses efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN computationally intensive tasks are performed THEN the system SHALL utilize AWS Lambda for processing
2. WHEN LLM capabilities are needed THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock for text generation and summarization
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL be scalable to handle multiple concurrent requests
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriately using AWS CloudWatch

### Requirement 8: Data Input and Output Management

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to easily input DNA sequence files and receive structured outputs, so that I can integrate the results with other bioinformatics tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading data THEN the system SHALL accept common DNA sequence file formats (FASTA, GenBank, etc.)
2. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide structured JSON outputs for programmatic access
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide both human-readable and machine-readable formats
4. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and traceability throughout the workflow
