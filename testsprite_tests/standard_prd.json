    "Each agent processes data using domain-specific methods and external APIs, storing intermediate results in S3 and state in DynamoDB.",
    "The orchestrator manages workflow states and triggers successive agents until workflow completion.",
    "Users view results via interactive visualization components including charts and 3D protein viewers on the frontend.",
    "Cost monitoring and optimization services track AWS resource utilization and provide insights.",
    "Users or developers can also run analyses via a CLI interface for automation or batch processing.",
    "Comprehensive error handling and recovery ensure reliable workflows even in case of partial failures."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "GenomicsAgent correctly identifies known gene sequences and mutations on test datasets with high accuracy.",
    "ProteomicsAgent accurately retrieves and renders protein structures from PDB data.",
    "LiteratureAgent generates meaningful and concise summaries from scientific articles using Amazon Bedrock.",
    "DrugAgent identifies relevant drug candidates and clinical trial information matching query parameters.",
    "DecisionAgent outputs coherent, medically relevant reports validated by domain experts.",
    "WorkflowOrchestrator reliably manages agent execution and maintains consistent workflow state in DynamoDB.",
    "Frontend UI passes usability testing with fast load times and clear data visualizations.",
    "System demonstrates scalability and fault tolerance under simulated high load conditions.",
    "AWS infrastructure deployments succeed using CDK without errors, integrating monitoring and cost optimization.",
    "Caching system reduces redundant computations and improves response times effectively.",
    "Error handling recovers gracefully from failures without data loss or workflow inconsistencies.",
    "CLI interface runs complete workflows and produces results identical to the frontend-initiated runs.",
    "End-to-end testing covers all integrated components with high code coverage."
