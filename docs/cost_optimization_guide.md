## 🎯 Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Smart Bedrock Usage** (Biggest Cost Driver)
```python
# ✅ DO: Use Bedrock only for high-impact features
bedrock_usage = {
    "final_medical_reports": "Use Bedrock - judges will see this",
    "treatment_recommendations": "Use Bedrock - high clinical value", 
    "literature_summaries": "Use free alternatives - not critical",
    "basic_analysis": "Use local processing - save money"
}

# ✅ Optimize token usage
def optimize_bedrock_calls():
    # Use shorter, focused prompts
    # Cache results to avoid repeat calls
    # Only generate reports for demo cases
    pass
```

### 2. **Maximize Free Tier Usage**
```python
# ✅ All these services are FREE within limits:
free_tier_services = {
    "Lambda": "1M requests/month (you'll use ~1000)",
    "API Gateway": "1M requests/month (you'll use ~1000)", 
    "DynamoDB": "25GB storage (you'll use ~1GB)",
    "S3": "5GB storage (you'll use ~2GB)",
    "CloudWatch": "Basic monitoring included"
}
```

### 3. **Alternative to Paid APIs**
```python
# ❌ AVOID: Paid APIs that drain budget
paid_apis = {
    "DrugBank": "$500+/month - TOO EXPENSIVE",
    "Commercial genomics APIs": "$100+/month - TOO EXPENSIVE"
}

# ✅ USE: Free alternatives
free_alternatives = {
    "ChEMBL": "Free drug database",
    "PubMed": "Free literature database", 
    "ClinVar": "Free variant database",
    "UniProt": "Free protein database",
    "AlphaFold": "Free structure database"
}
```

## 💡 Money-Saving Tips

### **1. Bedrock Optimization**
```python
# ✅ Smart prompt engineering
def create_efficient_prompt(data):
    # Use concise, focused prompts
    # Avoid unnecessary context
    # Request specific output format
    return f"Generate medical report for: {essential_data_only}"

# ✅ Cache expensive operations
bedrock_cache = {}
def cached_bedrock_call(prompt):
    if prompt in bedrock_cache:
        return bedrock_cache[prompt]
    result = bedrock_client.generate_text(prompt)
    bedrock_cache[prompt] = result
    return result
```

### **2. Lambda Optimization**
```python
# ✅ Optimize Lambda memory and timeout
lambda_config = {
    "memory": 512,  # Start small, increase if needed
    "timeout": 30,  # Most operations complete in <30s
    "runtime": "python3.9"  # Efficient runtime
}
```

### **3. Data Transfer Optimization**
```python
# ✅ Minimize data transfer costs
def optimize_api_calls():
    # Batch API requests when possible
    # Use compression for large responses
    # Cache frequently accessed data
    pass
```

## 📈 Monitoring Your Spend

### **Daily Cost Tracking**
```python
# Set up cost alerts
cost_alerts = {
    "daily_budget": 2.00,  # $2/day = $60/month
    "weekly_budget": 10.00,  # $10/week = $40/month
    "monthly_budget": 35.00  # Stay well under $100
}
```

### **AWS Cost Explorer Setup**
1. ✅ Enable detailed billing
2. ✅ Set up budget alerts at $25, $50, $75
3. ✅ Monitor daily spend
4. ✅ Track service-by-service costs

## 🎯 Winning Strategy: Maximum Impact per Dollar

### **High-Impact, Low-Cost Features**
1. **Bedrock Agents** ($15-20) - HUGE judge impact
2. **Clinical Decision Making** ($5-10) - Medical relevance
3. **Multi-Agent Coordination** ($0) - Technical sophistication
4. **Real API Integration** ($0) - Professional quality

### **Demo Scenarios (Budget: $15-20)**
```python
demo_scenarios = [
    {
        "name": "BRCA1 Cancer Risk Assessment",
        "bedrock_cost": "$3-4",
        "impact": "VERY HIGH - personalized medicine"
    },
    {
        "name": "Pharmacogenomics Analysis", 
        "bedrock_cost": "$3-4",
        "impact": "HIGH - drug personalization"
    },
    {
        "name": "Rare Disease Diagnosis",
        "bedrock_cost": "$3-4", 
        "impact": "HIGH - clinical utility"
    },
    {
        "name": "Multi-Gene Panel Analysis",
        "bedrock_cost": "$3-4",
        "impact": "MEDIUM - comprehensive analysis"
    }
]
```

## 🚨 Emergency Cost Controls

### **If Approaching Budget Limit**
1. **Stop Bedrock usage immediately**
2. **Use cached/pre-generated reports**
3. **Switch to local LLM for demos**
4. **Focus on existing functionality**

### **Fallback Demo Strategy**
```python
# If budget runs out, still impressive:
fallback_features = [
    "Multi-agent coordination (free)",
    "Real API integration (free)", 
    "Genomics analysis (free)",
    "Clinical decision logic (free)",
    "Professional architecture (free)"
]
```

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### **Before Spending Any Money**
- [ ] Test all free components locally
- [ ] Verify API integrations work
- [ ] Prepare demo data and scenarios
- [ ] Set up cost monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Have fallback plan ready

### **Smart Deployment Order**
1. **Deploy free infrastructure first**
2. **Test everything without Bedrock**
3. **Add Bedrock only when ready for demos**
4. **Generate demo reports in batches**
